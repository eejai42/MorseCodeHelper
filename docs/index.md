# [](#header-1)Morse Code SDK Documentation

This documentation describes the Morse Code SDK contained by this repo.  What is described here 
should be true consistently and pervasively throughout the tech stack - as as it grows/changes 
over time.


There are multiple "morse code alphabets" or dialects - they are described here.

## [Supported Alphabets](morse-code.html).
## [Github Repo](https://github.com/eejai42/MorseCodeHelper).
